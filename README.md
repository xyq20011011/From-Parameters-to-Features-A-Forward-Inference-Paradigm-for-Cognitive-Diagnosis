From Parameters to Features: A Forward-Inference Paradigm for Cognitive Diagnosis

This repository contains the open-source code for the paper "From Parameters to Features: A Forward-Inference Paradigm for Cognitive Diagnosis". The work presents a novel approach to cognitive diagnosis using a forward-inference paradigm that improves upon traditional models by addressing challenges related to unseen students and data sparsity.

We will be organizing and releasing the code and related resources for this study to facilitate further research and development in the field. Stay tuned for updates and the full release of the codebase.
